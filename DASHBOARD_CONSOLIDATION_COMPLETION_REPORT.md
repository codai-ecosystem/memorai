## 🚫 Known Issues (NOT blocking main task)

### MCP Server Local Development Issues
The MCP server has persistent dependency resolution issues:

```
Error: Cannot find package 'E:\GitHub\memorai\node_modules\.pnpm\@modelcontextprotocol+sdk@1.12.2\node_modules\zod\index.js'
```

**Root Cause:** pnpm + ESM module resolution conflict
**Impact:** MCP server won't start locally for development
**Status:** Does not affect the dashboard consolidation task
**Note:** This is a pre-existing issue, not introduced by the consolidation

### Attempts Made to Fix MCP Issues:
1. ✅ Verified dependencies are installed
2. ✅ Tried enabling shamefully-hoist in .npmrc
3. ✅ Force reinstalled packages
4. ✅ Built MCP package successfully
5. ⚠️ Hit additional missing dependencies (openai package)
6. 🔄 Started creating simplified MCP server (partial)
