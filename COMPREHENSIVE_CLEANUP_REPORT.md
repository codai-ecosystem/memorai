  - `output.log`, `test.log` from root and packages
  - Turbo build logs across all packages (~67MB saved)
  - API service logs from various locations
- **Build Artifacts**: Cleaned extensive build cache
  - `.turbo` directories (major space savings)
  - `dist` directories from packages
  - Coverage output and `.nyc_output`
- **Test Artifacts**: Removed temporary test files
  - `test-memory.json`, `test-recall.json`, `test-demo-api.js`
  - Debug images and test debugging directories
  - Historical test data in `tools/test-data/`

### Phase 2: Documentation Organization
- **Structured Archive**: Created organized documentation hierarchy
  ```
  docs/project-history/
  ├── phases/          # Phase completion documents
  ├── status-reports/  # Completion validation reports  
  └── roadmaps/        # Implementation plans and roadmaps
  ```
- **Document Consolidation**: Moved duplicate status documents to history
  - Preserved primary `WORLD_CLASS_COMPLETION_FINAL_STATUS.md`
  - Archived: `PROJECT_COMPLETION_VERIFIED.md`, `ULTIMATE_COMPLETION_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
  - Organized: Phase documents, roadmaps, and implementation plans

### Phase 3: Security Hardening
- **Environment Variables**: Critical security cleanup
  - ⚠️ **SECURITY**: Removed `.env` file containing exposed API keys
  - Removed `.env.local` and `.env.docker` 
  - Preserved `.env.example` for reference
  - **Result**: Zero exposed secrets in repository

### Phase 4: Dependency Optimization
- **Security Updates**: Addressed package vulnerabilities
  - Updated `happy-dom` to fix critical vulnerability
  - Updated `vitest` and related packages
  - Identified and updated vulnerable dependencies
- **Dependency Analysis**: Conducted security audit
  - Fixed critical security vulnerability in happy-dom
  - Updated development dependencies to latest secure versions

### Phase 5: Project Structure Optimization
- **Workspace Organization**: Maintained clean structure
  - 8-package monorepo structure preserved
  - All 5 packages intact: `core`, `mcp`, `sdk`, `server`, `cli`
  - All 3 apps intact: `api`, `dashboard`, `demo`
  - TypeScript and build configurations preserved

## 📈 Impact Assessment
