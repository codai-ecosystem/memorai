# Testing Status Update - Critical Issue Identified

## 🛑 CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE - Test Runner Failure

### Issue Description:
- **All test files showing "(0)" tests and failing to execute**
- API tests that were previously working are now not running
- Component tests not executing
- E2E tests not executing

### Error Pattern:
```
 ❯ tests/unit/api/config.test.ts (0)
 ❯ tests/unit/api/stats.test.ts (0)
 ❯ tests/unit/api/memory-context.test.ts (0)
⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ Failed Suites 3 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
```

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED (Before Runner Issue):
1. **config.test.ts syntax error** - Fixed missing closing braces
2. **Missing lucide-react icons** - Added SortDesc, SortAsc to test mocks
3. **Close button data-testid** - Added to memory-actions component  
4. **Ambiguous selectors** - Partially fixed in memory-actions tests

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:

### Priority 1: Fix Test Runner (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Investigate test configuration issues
- [ ] Check if recent changes to test setup affected imports
- [ ] Verify vitest.config.ts configuration
- [ ] Check test setup file imports
- [ ] Restore basic test execution capability

### Priority 2: Resume Component Testing (After Runner Fixed)
- [ ] Fix remaining ambiguous selectors 
- [ ] Update CSS class expectations to match actual components
- [ ] Fix user event keyboard input issues
- [ ] Complete memory-actions test fixes
- [ ] Fix dashboard-header test issues
- [ ] Fix memory-overview test issues

## 📋 STATUS BEFORE ISSUE:
- **API Tests**: 13/13 passing (config, stats, memory-context)
- **Component Tests**: Infrastructure ready but many failing due to selector/expectation issues
- **E2E Tests**: All passing in Chromium

## 🔧 POTENTIAL CAUSES OF RUNNER ISSUE:
1. Syntax errors in test files (especially from recent edits)
2. Import path issues in test setup
3. Vitest configuration changes
4. Circular dependency or module loading issues
5. Changes to lucide-react mock affecting imports

## 🚨 NEXT ACTIONS:
1. **Revert recent changes** if needed to restore test runner
2. **Methodically re-apply fixes** one at a time
3. **Test after each change** to identify what broke the runner
4. **Document the exact cause** for future reference
