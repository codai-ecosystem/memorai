# Comprehensive Testing Plan for Web Dashboard

## Challenge Accepted: Test Everything!

This document outlines the complete testing strategy for every possible flow, page, section, and component in the dashboard project.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (Vitest + Testing Library)
- [ ] All React components (8 dashboard components)
- [ ] All stores (memory-store, config-store)
- [ ] All utilities (api-client, utils)
- [ ] All API routes (4 routes)
- [ ] All hooks and custom logic

### 2. Integration Tests
- [ ] Store + Component interactions
- [ ] API + Store integrations
- [ ] Cross-component data flow
- [ ] Theme provider integration

### 3. E2E Tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Complete user journeys
- [ ] All navigation flows
- [ ] Form submissions and interactions
- [ ] Error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Mobile and desktop responsive testing

## Components to Test

### Core Pages
- [x] `page.tsx` (DashboardPage) - PARTIALLY TESTED
- [ ] `layout.tsx` (RootLayout)

### Dashboard Components
- [ ] `header.tsx` (DashboardHeader)
- [ ] `sidebar.tsx` (DashboardSidebar)
- [ ] `memory-overview.tsx` (MemoryOverview)
- [ ] `memory-actions.tsx` (MemoryActions)
- [ ] `memory-search.tsx` (MemorySearch)
- [ ] `memory-results.tsx` (MemoryResults)
- [ ] `analytics.tsx` (AnalyticsDashboard)
- [ ] `system-config.tsx` (SystemConfiguration)

### Providers
- [ ] `theme-provider.tsx` (ThemeProvider)

### Stores
- [ ] `memory-store.ts` (useMemoryStore)
- [ ] `config-store.ts` (useConfigStore)

### Utilities
- [ ] `api-client.ts`
- [ ] `utils.ts`

### API Routes
- [ ] `/api/memory/context/route.ts`
- [ ] `/api/memory/remember/route.ts`
- [ ] `/api/config/route.ts`
- [ ] `/api/stats/route.ts`

## Test Scenarios for Each Component

### Testing Dimensions
1. **Rendering** - Does it render without errors?
2. **Props** - Does it handle all prop variations?
3. **State** - Does internal state work correctly?
4. **User Interactions** - Do clicks, forms, etc. work?
5. **Error Handling** - Does it handle errors gracefully?
6. **Loading States** - Are loading states handled?
7. **Accessibility** - ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen readers
8. **Responsive Design** - Mobile, tablet, desktop
9. **Theme Support** - Light/dark mode
10. **Performance** - Large datasets, many items

## Coverage Goals
- **Unit Tests**: 100% line coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: All user flows
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Lighthouse scores > 90

## Tools and Setup
- Vitest for unit/integration tests
- @testing-library/react for component testing
- @testing-library/jest-dom for DOM assertions
- Playwright for E2E testing
- @axe-core/playwright for accessibility testing
- Lighthouse CI for performance testing

## Execution Plan
1. Complete unit test suite for all components
2. Integration tests for store/component interactions
3. Comprehensive E2E test suite with Playwright
4. Performance and accessibility audits
5. Run full test suite and verify 100% coverage
