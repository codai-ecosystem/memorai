# MCP Server Fix Summary

## Issue Diagnosed and Resolved ✅

### Problem
The memorai-mcp server was failing to start in VS Code with an ENOENT error because the VS Code MCP configuration was using the command `memorai-mcp` which was not available in the system PATH.

### Root Cause
VS Code settings.json was configured to use:
```json
"MemoraiMCPServer": {
  "command": "memorai-mcp",
  "args": [],
  "env": {
    "MEMORAI_STORAGE_TYPE": "memory",
    "MEMORAI_LOG_LEVEL": "info"
  }
}
```

However, the `memorai-mcp` command was not globally installed or available in PATH.

### Solution Applied
Updated VS Code settings.json to use the full path to the built server:
```json
"MemoraiMCPServer": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "E:/GitHub/memorai/packages/mcp/dist/server.js"
  ],
  "env": {
    "MEMORAI_STORAGE_TYPE": "memory",
    "MEMORAI_LOG_LEVEL": "info"
  }
}
```

### Verification
✅ Built the MCP package successfully  
✅ Confirmed dist/server.js exists  
✅ Tested server startup - starts correctly  
✅ Tested MCP protocol communication - responds properly  
✅ Verified all 4 tools are available: remember, recall, forget, context  

### Server Status
- **Protocol Version**: 2024-11-05
- **Server Version**: 1.0.4
- **Available Tools**: 4 (remember, recall, forget, context)
- **Configuration**: Uses .env.example for environment setup
- **Environment Note**: MEMORAI_OPENAI_API_KEY needed for full embedding functionality

### Additional Notes
- Server gracefully handles missing OpenAI API key (operates in limited mode)
- Environment configuration file (.env.example) already exists
- All MCP protocol communication working correctly
- Ready for use in VS Code with GitHub Copilot

## Project Status: 100% Complete ✅

The Memorai MCP project cleanup and server configuration is now fully complete. The server is ready for production use in VS Code workspaces.
