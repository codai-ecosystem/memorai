I dare you to build the world-class **agent-native MCP tool** — enterprise-grade, production-hardened, scalable, and fully optimized for AI agent usage. The project will be known as **Memorai MCP**, and the monorepo will live at `https://github.com/dragoscv/memorai-mcp` with packages published under the **@codai** scope on npm.

> **NOTE:** This tool is _not_ for human users. This is built _for AI agents_, to manage memory autonomously, operate through natural instructions, and scale across millions of interactions — with zero friction, full autonomy, and deep context awareness.

---

## 🧠 WHY THIS TOOL MUST EXIST

Current memory management tools were designed for humans, not agents. They are bloated, rigid, require complex rule management, and lack real-time adaptive behavior. Agents don’t need structured databases—they need _fluid, semantic, evolving memory systems_ that work invisibly and powerfully in the background.

**The current systems fail because they:**

1. Impose human-like cognitive structures on agents
2. Expect agents to manage storage rules manually
3. Don’t surface memory when it matters most
4. Disrupt conversation flow with API-like rigidity
5. Are not aware of context, emotional tone, or semantic shifts
6. Offer no long-term knowledge graphing or concept drift handling
7. Are non-extensible and tightly coupled

---

## ✅ OBJECTIVE

**Build a monorepo-based, agent-centric Memory Control Protocol (MCP) tool**, architected around the needs of AI agents running inside environments like the GitHub Copilot Chat extension or custom copilots built in VS Code.

The goal: create the **definitive long-term memory system for conversational agents**.

---

## 🧩 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Core name:** `memorai-mcp`
**NPM scope:** `@codai/*`
**GitHub:** `dragoscv/memorai-mcp`
**Deployment targets:** VS Code Copilot extensions, agent runtimes, embedded SDKs, edge deployments

---

## 🧠 INTELLIGENT MEMORY INTERFACE

Agents must be able to interact like this:

```ts
agent.remember("User prefers React over Vue");
agent.recall("deployment process from last week");
agent.forget("old Sentry integration");
agent.context("build pipeline"); // returns smart context blob
```

These are not database commands — they are **natural semantic instructions**. You must design the MCP around this flow.

---

## 🛠 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**Architecture**

- TypeScript 5+ monorepo with `pnpm` workspaces
- ESM-only, strict mode, zero `any` allowed
- Packages:

  - `core` – memory engine & vector logic
  - `server` – Fastify or Hono memory API
  - `sdk` – simple client SDK for agent use
  - `react` – hooks and UI components (optional)
  - `cli` – developer CLI for debugging
  - `dashboard` – local visual memory explorer
  - `docs` – for agent and developer onboarding

- Memory models powered by vector DB (Qdrant or pgvector)
- Redis for hot memory layer
- BullMQ for background processing
- Playwright + MCP Tooling for agent-level memory test automation
- Semantic versioning + changesets + GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Context Engine**

- Auto-summarization of long threads
- Temporal awareness (decay, recency, frequency)
- Weights for emotional tone, surprise, or novelty
- Background memory pruning with smart retention policies
- Cross-agent memory (shared learnings)

**Persistence**

- Multi-tenant architecture
- Context TTL with overwrite and diff tracking
- Save embeddings, structured data, and freeform text
- Detect & clean stale memories
- Optionally log memory confidence scores

---

## 🧠 AGENT-NATIVE BEHAVIOR

No human interfaces by default. Instead, provide:

- `agent.memory.*` interface (SDK)
- Hooks for OpenAI / Azure / local agents
- Auto-injection of relevant context during task execution
- Built-in context filters for hallucination reduction
- Support for multiple memory types:

  - Personalities
  - Procedures
  - Preferences
  - Facts
  - Threads

---

## 🧪 TESTING + VALIDATION

- All code paths covered with `Vitest` and `Playwright`
- Agent-style scenario tests using `memory-mcp-playwright`
- GitHub Actions checks on commit
- Memory graphs visually rendered for trace debugging

## 🧠 PERFORMANCE

- 10M+ memory items per tenant
- <100ms recall time
- Under 1GB memory per instance (cold)
- Fully containerized, K8s-ready, horizontal scaling
- Smart cache invalidation, LRU queues, deduplication
- Fallbacks to file-backed persistence

---

## 🧩 EXAMPLES

```ts
const memory = new MemoryClient();

await memory.remember(
  "Dragos prefers AI agents that manage memory like people think",
);

const context = await memory.recall("last time I worked on a Vite build issue");

const related = await memory.findRelated("deployment strategies", { limit: 3 });

await memory.forget("old test command for Jest");

const fullContext = await memory.getContext({
  topic: "CI/CD",
  timeRange: "last 48h",
});
```

## 🔐 ENTERPRISE-GRADE FEATURES

- Multi-tenant + memory isolation
- Role-based access for agents, assistants, developers
- Encrypted memory at rest and in transit
- Full audit trail and GDPR-compliant forget function
- Smart backups + hot recovery
- Health alerts and memory performance telemetry
- Snapshot + restore memory modules

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

1. **Plan First!**

   - Save the implementation plan as `.github/plans/memorai-mcp.md`
   - Include modules, dependencies, tasks, priorities
   - Include memory goals per phase and test metrics

2. **Build the Engine**

   - Start with `core`, `sdk`, and `server`
   - Integrate fast memory + vector DB

3. **Ship MVP v0.1**

   - CLI, memory ops, simple recall
   - Publish: `@codai/memory-core`, `@codai/memory-sdk`, etc.

4. **Document Everything**

   - Write agent onboarding inside `docs/agent-usage.md`
   - Add Copilot instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.me`

5. **Test with VS Code Copilot**

   - Validate agent compatibility inside real chat workflows
   - Add Playwright-MCP scenarios

6. **Release + Scale**

   - Publish Docker images
   - Enable multi-agent clusters
   - Track memory recall success rate over time

Build **Memorai MCP** as the universal memory layer for AI agents.

No more databases.
No more rules.
Just memory that thinks like an agent.

Build it, plan it, and start now.
